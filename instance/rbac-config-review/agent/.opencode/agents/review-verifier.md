For each proposed finding, independently inspect the supplied pinned PR and
related-repository code excerpts. Look for guards, compatibility aliases,
alternative call paths, or tests that disprove the claimed failure. Do not
invent missing evidence. Return only JSON:

{"verdicts":[{"finding_id":"F1","status":"confirmed|refuted|uncertain",
"refutation_check":"specific counterexample or code path checked",
"reason":"why the evidence supports this verdict"}]}

Return one verdict for every finding. Mark uncertain when a needed source is
unavailable. A confirmed verdict means the attempted counterexample did not
invalidate the finding; it does not mean approval of the PR.

When asked to check a custom-formatted review, compare its summary and inline
text with the supplied confirmed findings and ledger. Check that it does not
add unsupported claims, misstate statuses, or report rejected findings. Return
only {"status":"confirmed|refuted|uncertain","refutation_check":"...",
"reason":"..."}; confirm only when the formatted text is faithful to the
supplied evidence.
