# review-only workflow

`rbac-config-review` is a separate, review-only Rehor bot instance (not yet
deployed). Each cycle it reviews at most one GitHub PR labeled in
`review-context.yaml`, across the repositories in `project-repos.json`. It
never edits, commits, pushes, approves, requests changes, or merges — it keeps
one GitHub review summary per PR and edits it in place each cycle. It also
posts one idempotent inline thread per actionable finding, using the same
finding ID in the summary and inline comment.

To request a fresh pass without changing the PR, an organization member can
post a new top-level PR comment containing only `/review-bot re-review`.
The PR must still carry the configured review label. The bot verifies the
commenter's membership, reuses the existing finding ledger and summary, and
increments the review number in the summary heading. The first pass is
`Review #1`; multiple requests received before the next pass are coalesced.

Gray = deterministic script, $0, no model call. Red = an LLM reasons over
pinned context and can be wrong. Only `C`/`D` spend tokens; `A`/`B`/`E` are
plain Python and run every cycle regardless of whether anything needs review.

| Piece | File | Script or AI | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Queue | `preflight/01-review-queue.py` → `review_queue.py` | Script | Picks one labeled PR needing `review`, `resume`, or `feedback_check`; enforces the 10-task capacity limit and per-instance task isolation (`review-only:github:` prefix) |
| Config validation | `review_config.py` | Script | Loads and strictly validates `review-context.yaml` (GitHub URL shape, `.md`-only doc links, unique ids) |
| Context builder | `build_context.py` | Script | Checks out the PR head read-only, clones related repos at a pinned SHA, fetches configured Markdown docs at a pinned commit, writes `manifest.json` |
| Skill preparation | `review_skills.py` | Script | Selects dimensions, reads selected recipe YAML at a pinned commit, and generates per-run review skills |
| Impact analysis | `impact_analysis.py` | Script | Deterministically (no LLM) extracts changed identifiers from the diff and `git grep`-matches them in related repos → `impact.json`'s `consumer_usages` (candidates, not confirmed breakage) |
| Re-review request detection | `rereview_requests.py` | Script | Finds exact commands in top-level comments; the runner verifies each author's organization membership before acting |
| Review criteria | `skills/dimensional-review/SKILL.md` | **AI** (review-runner) | Multi-dimension review (correctness, security, `cross-repo-dependencies`, …) over the pinned context; deduped and consensus-scored |
| Explanation quality | `skills/explanatory-answer/SKILL.md` | **AI** (review-runner) | How to write evidence-grounded finding explanations and when a compact Mermaid graph can clarify a causal path or interaction |
| Verifier | `.opencode/agents/review-verifier.md` | **AI** (subagent) | Independently tries to refute every proposed finding using only pinned sources |
| Evidence gate | `review_evidence.py` | Script | Rejects any finding whose location/reference isn't a real pinned line; caps at seven findings; requires one verdict per finding; validates optional Mermaid sources and renders them in the summary and inline comments |
| Inline publisher | `post_inline_comments.py` | Script | Posts or updates one anchored comment per confirmed finding on the current PR head, deduplicated by finding ID |

Built-in dimensions have `default: true`; the GitHub KISS recipe is
`default: false` and may be selected explicitly. The bot's Python processor
reads its YAML directly and generates a per-run skill; no Goose runtime is
required. The generated skill gets the same pinned PR, related repositories,
docs, and impact report as the built-in passes. Recipe extensions and test
execution are not enabled by importing a recipe. The `high` level includes
the applicable built-in dimensions, including documentation and observability.
Dimension passes run sequentially; `review-verifier` checks their findings.
The high preset remains the default. For a documentation-only diff, dimensions
marked `skip_documentation_only` do not run; the current catalog selects six
passes instead of fourteen. Mixed code and documentation changes still select
the full applicable set, and an explicitly selected skill always runs.
The review-only workflow also uses `--skip-learn`. Its LEARN phase would produce
notes that this instance cannot save to shared memory or include in the
validated PR review; skipping it leaves the finding and verification steps intact.

Each repository can list dimension names in `review-context.yaml` under
`repositories.<repo-key>.skills`. These skills always run for that repository,
including when their catalog entry has `default: false` or the selected level
would exclude them. For example, a repository may explicitly include
`goose-kiss-review`. These names are combined with the default or focused
dimensions without duplicates. Unknown or duplicate skill names are
configuration errors.

Set `format: custom` beside a repository's `skills` to use those skills'
report layouts for its review summary and any inline comments they specify.
Each selected skill must complete and its actual result is saved. The runner
formats confirmed findings using each skill's pinned guide, with a separate
section per skill; findings from other dimensions remain clearly separate.
An independent verifier checks each guide's layout, verdict, and attribution
before the evidence gate writes the review. IDs and the review number remain
present; standard labels and the standard footer are not added. Repositories
without this setting use the standard format.

## The task queue: review_queue.py

Runs every cycle, for $0, before any AI session. For every repo in
`project-repos.json`, it lists open PRs carrying `review_label` and classifies
each one — a session only launches if a PR survives all of this:

1. **Filters out**: drafts, PRs authored by the bot itself, and PRs missing a
   head/base SHA. A PR paused for its current SHA pair is checked only when
   there is newer feedback; an authorized command can explicitly retry it.
2. **Classifies survivors** into exactly one of three kinds (first match
   wins):

   | Kind | Condition | Priority |
   |---|---|---|
   | `resume` | Task status is `in_progress`/`pr_open`/`pr_changes` — a prior cycle was interrupted | 0 (highest) |
   | `review` | No task yet, or current head/base SHA differs from `last_reviewed_sha`/`last_reviewed_base_sha` | 1 |
   | `feedback_check` | SHA unchanged (including a paused task), but `updatedAt` is newer than `last_seen_updated_at`; authorized commands start a fresh review | 2 (lowest) |

   Everything else (already reviewed, nothing newer) is excluded.
3. **Picks exactly one** candidate across every repo, sorted by
   `(priority, updatedAt, repo, number)` — one PR per cycle, oldest
   highest-priority first.
4. **Capacity gate**: a brand-new `review` is skipped if 10 tasks are already
   active, even if otherwise eligible. A feedback check also checks capacity
   before starting a requested re-review.

Requests are matched exactly from new top-level comments, bounded by the
preflight timestamp, and deduplicated using comment IDs in task state. The
runner verifies org membership; ordinary feedback does not trigger a review.
Requests arriving after a review starts are left for a later cycle. A validated
but unfinished publication is recorded in task state so retries reuse its body
and number rather than counting another review.
When the queue otherwise has no work, it also checks comments at the stored
timestamp boundary: GitHub's second-precision `updatedAt` can be unchanged by
a request made in that same second. This costs a comment API call per idle,
already-reviewed labeled PR until a request is found.

### What identifies a task

Every task has three identity fields, always used together:

- **`external_key`** — `task_key(repo, number)` =
  `review-only:github:<owner>/<repo>#<number>` (e.g.
  `review-only:github:project-kessel/insights-rbac#42`). Built once in
  `review_queue.py` and threaded through every subsequent `task_get`/
  `task_update` call for that PR.
- **`source_type`** — always `"github"` (this instance reviews GitHub PRs
  only; a GitLab MR would need an `"gitlab"` adapter, not built).
- **`instance_id`** — `$BOT_INSTANCE_ID` (e.g. `fabric-access-review`).

All three matter because bot-memory is **shared** across instances —
`rbac-config` (the Jira sprint bot), `rbac-config-konflux`, and this review
instance can all have tasks in the same memory server. `review_queue.py`'s
`load_tasks()` filters strictly on
`source_type == "github" and external_key.startswith("review-only:github:")`
— so even a task for the exact same PR number created by a different
instance is invisible to this one. There is no author-based or label-based
task filtering; the `external_key` prefix *is* the isolation boundary.

### Memory: task state vs. the shared RAG store

`bot-memory` provides two different things, and this instance treats them
differently. **Task state** (`task_add`/`task_update`/`bot_status_update`) —
the SHA pairs, `review_id`, `update_count`, `ledger_path` above — is this
instance's own bookkeeping and stays fully read/write; the pipeline can't
function without it. The **shared RAG learning store**
(`memory_store`/`memory_search`, categories `learning`/`review_feedback`/
`codebase_pattern`, also readable team-wide via the read-only `team-memory`
MCP endpoint) is read-only for this instance — `review-runner.md`'s
permissions deny `bot-memory_memory_store` and `bot-memory_memory_delete`.
It still searches that store for leads (AGENTS.md step 2), it just never
writes a new learning or feedback entry to it; its own history lives in task
state, not shared memory.

## Building context

What `build_context.py` actually does, zooming into the "Context" stage box
above — every fetch is pinned to an exact SHA/commit as it happens:

**Data sources** — everything `build_context.py` reads from outside itself:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Config["Local config"]
        S1[("review-context.yaml<br/>related repos + doc links")]
        S2[("project-repos.json<br/>repo_key → upstream URL")]
    end
    subgraph GH["GitHub"]
        S3["PR metadata + diff<br/>(gh pr view / gh pr diff)"]
        S4["PR repo git remote<br/>(pull/&lt;n&gt;/head)"]
        S5["Related repos git remote<br/>(shallow clone)"]
        S6["Doc files via API<br/>(contents endpoint)"]
    end

    classDef config fill:#fff3cd,stroke:#b38600,color:#000;
    classDef github fill:#d9edf7,stroke:#31708f,color:#000;
    class S1,S2 config;
    class S3,S4,S5,S6 github;
```

**Pipeline** — each step names the source(s) it consumes, in order:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    P1["Resolve target repo<br/>(project-repos.json)"] --> P2["Verify head/base SHA<br/>(PR metadata)"]
    P2 --> P3["Snapshot diff,<br/>extract search terms<br/>(PR diff)"]
    P3 --> P4["Checkout PR head<br/>(pinned, PR repo git)"]
    P4 --> P5["Clone/refresh related repos,<br/>pin SHA, git grep terms<br/>(review-context.yaml + related repos git)"]
    P5 --> P6["Fetch docs, pin to commit<br/>(review-context.yaml + doc files API)"]
    P6 --> P7["impact_analysis.py"]
    P7 --> M[("manifest.json<br/>+ impact.json")]
```

A failed related-repo clone or doc fetch doesn't abort the run — it's
recorded as `{"error": ...}` on that one entry, surfaced later as
`unavailable_sources` rather than silently skipped.

### manifest.json: the trust boundary

The complete, pinned snapshot: the PR's identity and SHAs, the local
checkout path, each related repo's pinned SHA/path/grep matches, each
fetched doc's pinned permalink, and a pointer to `impact.json`.

It exists because the pipeline needs one object that answers "what did we
actually fetch, and at exactly which revision?" — and that object then
doubles as the **authorization list for evidence**. `review_evidence.py`'s
`validate_ref()`/`source_root()` reject any finding whose cited `{repo, sha,
file, line}` isn't something `manifest.json` actually pinned. A finding can't
invent a convenient-sounding reference to a repo or revision nobody fetched —
only what's in the manifest is citable at all.

### impact.json: the cheap cross-repo pre-filter

A deterministic (no LLM), purely textual report: which identifiers changed
in the diff, and which related-repo `git grep` hits also contain one of
those identifiers (`consumer_usages`) — each tagged `"status": "candidate"`,
plus `unavailable_sources` for anything that failed to fetch.

It exists so the AI reviewer doesn't have to manually re-search every
related repo for every changed name on every cycle — that's slow and
expensive to do by hand, in an LLM turn, for each identifier. The script
does that legwork once, cheaply, and hands the `cross-repo-dependencies`
dimension a shortlist of concrete candidates to check instead. It is
explicitly leads, not verdicts: plain string matching can't tell a real
dependency from a coincidental name collision, which is exactly why a
candidate still has to survive the review skill's judgment, review-verifier's
refutation, and `review_evidence.py`'s pinned-reference check before it can
become a published finding.

## One review cycle

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Q as Preflight
    participant R as review-runner
    participant V as review-verifier
    participant GH as GitHub

    Q->>R: one PR (review / resume / feedback_check)
    Note over Q,R: skipped entirely if no PR needs attention
    rect rgb(226, 227, 229)
        R->>R: build_context.py → manifest.json + impact.json
    end
    rect rgb(248, 215, 218)
        R->>R: selected review skills + explanatory-answer → findings.json
        R->>V: findings + pinned context
        V->>R: verdicts.json (confirmed/refuted/uncertain)
    end
    rect rgb(226, 227, 229)
        R->>R: review_evidence.py → publication.json + inline-comments.json + ledger.json
    end
    R->>GH: create/update one review summary
    R->>GH: post/update inline threads using stable finding IDs
    R->>Q: task_update (last_reviewed_sha, review_id, update_count)
```

Gray bands are script (no model call); the red band is where an LLM
actually reasons — review-runner proposing findings, and review-verifier
trying to refute them.

## Finding shape

The selected review passes are converted into this schema before the
verifier/evidence steps:

```json
{
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "F1",
      "category": "cross_repo|contract|deploy|invariant|local",
      "location": {"repo": "owner/repo", "file": "path", "line": 1, "side": "added|removed"},
      "claim": "...",
      "trigger": "specific input or code path",
      "impact": "...",
      "evidence": {
        "explanation": "...",
        "refs": [{"repo": "owner/repo", "sha": "40-character pinned SHA", "file": "path", "line": 1}]
      },
      "suggested_fix": "..."
    }
  ]
}
```

A `cross_repo` finding must cite a concrete related-repository reference —
normally a `consumer_usages` entry from `impact.json` — never the
`review-context.yaml` relationship declaration alone.

## Ledger: one review, updated over time

The first cycle writes an initial `ledger.json` with every confirmed finding
marked open; its IDs are carried forward unchanged on later cycles.

From a task's second cycle onward, `review_evidence.py` also takes a prior
`ledger.json` (every finding ever confirmed for this task, each `open` or
`addressed`) and a proposed re-check of each `open` entry:

```json
{"verifications": [
  {"finding_id": "F1", "status": "addressed|still_open|uncertain",
   "explanation": "...",
   "refs": [{"repo": "owner/repo", "sha": "...", "file": "path", "line": 1}]}
]}
```

`refs` is required only for `"addressed"` — review-verifier must also confirm
those (same adversarial check as new findings) before the ledger entry closes.
`"still_open"`/`"uncertain"` need no verdict. One re-check per currently-open
entry is required; the merged result becomes the new `ledger.json`, and the
posted review body gets two sections — *Previously Flagged* (carried entries,
✅ addressed or ⚠️ still open) and *New Findings* (this cycle's) — plus an
`Review #N` heading, starting at 1. Each heading uses the finding's stable ID;
new inline comments start with that same ID and state the originating dimension
alongside the other bold finding labels.

## Example comments

Both generated by actually running `render_review`/`render_ledger`, not
hand-written. F1's fields below are what `skills/explanatory-answer/SKILL.md`
asks for applied directly: `claim` is the direct assertion, `trigger` is the
concrete input, `impact` is the specific consequence, `evidence` cites a
pinned line instead of a remembered impression of HBI's code.

**First cycle** (`render_review` — no ledger yet):

```markdown
## Review #1

### [F1] Old permission name disappears while HBI still sends it

**Dimension:** cross-repo-dependencies

**Location:** `api/permissions.py:1`

**Trigger:** HBI calls check_permission("inventory.read_hosts") on every host-read request

**Impact:** HBI requests to the inventory API are rejected with 403 after this PR merges

**Evidence:** HBI's client.py still sends the old permission string

- [RedHatInsights/insights-host-inventory:client.py:1](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-host-inventory/blob/c3c3.../client.py#L1)

**Suggested fix:** Keep inventory.read_hosts as an accepted alias until HBI migrates

To request another review, comment `/review-bot re-review` on this PR.

<!-- fabric-access-review:a1a1...:b2b2... -->
```

The corresponding inline comment starts with the same identifier:

```markdown
**[F1]** Old permission name disappears while HBI still sends it

**Dimension:** cross-repo-dependencies

**Location:** `api/permissions.py:1`

**Trigger:** HBI calls check_permission("inventory.read_hosts") on every host-read request

**Impact:** HBI requests to the inventory API are rejected with 403 after this PR merges

**Evidence:** HBI's client.py still sends the old permission string

**Suggested fix:** Keep inventory.read_hosts as an accepted alias until HBI migrates

<!-- fabric-access-finding:F1 -->
```

**Follow-up cycle, same comment edited in place** (`render_ledger` — F1 got
fixed, F2 is still open, and F3 is new this cycle — the mixed case that
shows what the status comment is actually for):

```markdown
## Review #4

Reviewed through `d4d4d4d4d4d4`.

## Previously Flagged

### [F1] Old permission name disappears while HBI still sends it — ✅ Addressed

**Dimension:** cross-repo-dependencies

**Location:** `api/permissions.py:1`

**Trigger:** HBI calls check_permission("inventory.read_hosts") on every host-read request

**Impact:** HBI requests to the inventory API are rejected with 403 after this PR merges

**Evidence:** HBI's client.py still sends the old permission string
- [RedHatInsights/insights-host-inventory:client.py:1](https://github.com/RedHatInsights/insights-host-inventory/blob/c3c3.../client.py#L1)

**Suggested fix:** Keep inventory.read_hosts as an accepted alias until HBI migrates

**Status evidence:** Commit adds ALIAS = "inventory.read_hosts" alongside the new permission name
- [project-kessel/insights-rbac:api/permissions.py:2](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-rbac/blob/d4d4.../api/permissions.py#L2)

### [F2] Unbounded retry loop with no backoff — ⚠️ Still open

**Dimension:** performance

**Location:** `api/permissions.py:4`

**Trigger:** The sync worker retries after a transient failure

**Impact:** Sustained failures can keep the worker retrying indefinitely

**Evidence:** The retry loop has no backoff or max-attempts check
- [project-kessel/insights-rbac:api/permissions.py:4](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-rbac/blob/d4d4.../api/permissions.py#L4)

**Suggested fix:** Add bounded retries with backoff

**Status:** sync() still retries with no backoff or max-attempts check

## New Findings

### [F3] New ALIAS constant is not validated against the active permission schema

**Dimension:** correctness

**Location:** `api/permissions.py:2`

**Trigger:** A consumer requests inventory.read_hosts after the alias list changes again

**Impact:** Silently grants or denies access inconsistently with the documented schema

**Evidence:** ALIAS is a bare string with no schema validation nearby

- [project-kessel/insights-rbac:api/permissions.py:2](https://github.com/project-kessel/insights-rbac/blob/d4d4.../api/permissions.py#L2)

**Suggested fix:** Validate ALIAS entries against the permission schema at startup

<!-- fabric-access-review:d4d4...:b2b2... -->
```

These two are the PR review comment (GitHub). Separately, `bot_status_update`
("Use bot_status_update with this instance ID at cycle start and end",
AGENTS.md) drives the dashboard banner, not a PR comment — `state`
(`working`/`idle`/`error`), `message`, `external_key?`, `repo?`,
`instance_id?`:

```
bot_status_update(instance_id="fabric-access-review", state="working",
  message="Reviewing PR #42", external_key="review-only:github:project-kessel/insights-rbac#42",
  repo="insights-rbac")
...
bot_status_update(instance_id="fabric-access-review", state="idle",
  message="Posted Review #3")
```

or, when preflight found nothing to do that cycle:

```
bot_status_update(instance_id="fabric-access-review", state="idle",
  message="No PR needs review")
```

## Guardrails

- **review-runner** permissions deny `edit`, all subagents except
  `review-verifier`, `webfetch`, `websearch`, and the shell patterns
  `git push*`, `git commit*`, `gh pr merge*`, `gh pr edit*`, `gh pr
  review*--approve*`.
- **review-verifier** permissions deny `edit`, `shell`, all subagents,
  `webfetch`, and `websearch` — it can only reason over the context it's
  given.
- Idempotency: a task's `review_id` (once set) means every later cycle edits
  that same review via `PUT .../reviews/<review_id>` instead of posting a new
  one — there is at most one review summary per PR. The inline publisher
  upserts comments by finding ID for the current head, so retries do not
  duplicate a thread. In standard format, summary headings use `### [F1]` and
  matching inline comments start with `**[F1]**`. Custom formats keep the same
  IDs in the selected skill's layout. GitHub may create separate review records for inline
  comments; the tracked `review_id` remains the summary review's ID. A
  `<!-- fabric-access-review:<head_sha>:<base_sha> -->`
  marker in the summary records which revision it reflects. `feedback_check`
  cycles do not touch `review_id` or inline threads unless an authorized
  re-review command starts the normal review path. Ordinary human feedback is
  recorded in task state; this instance cannot write to shared memory.
- Related repositories and linked docs are read-only context — they never
  expand the PR queue, and `review-context.yaml` is the only source of
  cross-repo relationships (no inferring or fetching unlisted repos).
